# FaceRecognition
Face detection is a computer vision technology that helps to locate/ visualize the human faces in images and predicts the identity of that face.   The Face Recognition System uses accurate computer algorithms to pick out the specific, distinctive details about a person’s face.   Such as the distance between the eyes or shape of the chin, are converted into a mathematical representations &amp; compared to data of other faces which are collected in a face recognition database.  The secret behind face recognition is a technique called ‘deep metric learning’.  We had implemented it in our many live applications like for log in using face recognition , door unlock on the basis of face recognition and many more.
